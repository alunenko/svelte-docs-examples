# Svelte components
Components are the building blocks of Svelte applications. They are written into .svelte files, using a superset of HTML.

All three sections — script, styles and markup — are optional.

```sveltehtml
<script>
	// logic goes here
</script>

<!-- markup (zero or more items) goes here -->

<style>
	/* styles go here */
</style>
```
