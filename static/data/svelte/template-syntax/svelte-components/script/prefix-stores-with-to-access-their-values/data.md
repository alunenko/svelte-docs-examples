# [Prefix stores with $ to access their values](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte-components#script-4-prefix-stores-with-$-to-access-their-values)
A _store_ is an object that allows reactive access to a value via a simple _store contract_. The svelte/store module contains minimal store implementations which fulfil this contract.

Any time you have a reference to a store, you can access its value inside a component by prefixing it with the `$` character. This causes Svelte to declare the prefixed variable, subscribe to the store at component initialization and unsubscribe when appropriate.

Assignments to `$`-prefixed variables require that the variable be a writable store, and will result in a call to the store's `.set` method.

Note that the store must be declared at the top level of the component â€” not inside an `if` block or a function, for example.

Local variables (that do not represent store values) must not have a `$` prefix.

```sveltehtml
<script>
	import { writable } from 'svelte/store';

	const count = writable(0);
	console.log($count); // logs 0

	count.set(1);
	console.log($count); // logs 1

	$count = 2;
	console.log($count); // logs 2
</script>
```

## [Store contract](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte-components#script-4-prefix-stores-with-$-to-access-their-values-store-contract)
```typescript
store = {
	subscribe: (subscription: (value: any) => void) => (() => void),
    set?: (value: any) => void
}
```

You can create your own stores without relying on svelte/store, by implementing the _store contract_:
1. A store must contain a `.subscribe` method, which must accept as its argument a subscription function. This subscription function must be immediately and synchronously called with the store's current value upon calling `.subscribe`. All of a store's active subscription functions must later be synchronously called whenever the store's value changes.
2. The `.subscribe` method must return an unsubscribe function. Calling an unsubscribe function must stop its subscription, and its corresponding subscription function must not be called again by the store.
3. A store may _optionally_ contain a `.set` method, which must accept as its argument a new value for the store, and which synchronously calls all of the store's active subscription functions. Such a store is called a _writable store_.

For interoperability with RxJS Observables, the `.subscribe` method is also allowed to return an object with an `.unsubscribe` method, rather than return the unsubscription function directly. Note however that unless `.subscribe` synchronously calls the subscription (which is not required by the Observable spec), Svelte will see the value of the store as `undefined` until it does.
